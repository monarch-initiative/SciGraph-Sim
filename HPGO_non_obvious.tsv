Coloboma is a hole in one of the structures of the eye, such as the iris, retina, choroid, or optic disc. If coloboma is present both in iris and retina it is known as irido-fundal coloboma.

This abnormality results from the improper development of certain nerves that control eye movement. Duane anomaly limits outward eye movement (toward the ear), and in some cases may limit inward eye movement (toward the nose).

This theory states that the products of all genes that are mutated in cystic kidney diseases in humans, mice, or zebrafish are expressed in primary cilia or centrosomes of renal epithelial cells. Primary cilia are sensory organelles that connect mechanosensory, visual, osmotic, and other stimuli to mechanisms of cell-cycle control and epithelial cell polarity. The ciliary theory explains the multiple organ involvement in NPHP regarding retinitis pigmentosa, liver fibrosis, ataxia, situs inversus, and mental retardation. Mutations in NPHP genes cause defects in signaling mechanisms, including the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway. The “ciliopathy” NPHP thereby is caused by defects in tissue differentiation and maintenance as a result of impaired processing of extracellular cues. Nephrocystins, the proteins that are encoded by NPHP genes, are highly conserved in evolution. Positional cloning of additional causative genes of NPHP will elucidate further signaling mechanisms that are involved, thereby establishing therapeutic approaches using animal models in mouse, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans.

Analysis of RBPJk-targeted embryos indicates that Notch ablation causes ectopic procardiogenic signaling in the proepicardium that in turn promotes myocardial differentiation in adjacent mesodermal progenitors, resulting in a premature muscularization of the sinus venosus horns
